## Responsive-Portfolio
 
Successfully created a navbar that appears the same on all 3 pages.
 
Majority of the content is media responsive due to being gridded up in bootstrap. I definitely feel like I learned a lot through this project. I understand the reason for mobile-first design. I felt like I was constantly compromising some of the cool stuff I could do in order to make it look better on mobile.
 
All the links should work, and use semantic HTML.
 
I used w3schools HTML validator.
 
My custom CSS is very basic, instead trying to utilize more bootstrap elements.
 
Instead of a footer, I made a sidebar instead. I liked it better as a cleaner option. It uses font-awesome to display icons that link to my linked-in and github. I could also integrate facebook and twitter, but I'm not a huge fan of doing that without having a professional facebook/twitter set up.
